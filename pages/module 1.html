                        <p> No part of our environment has escaped the effects of pollution. All over the world, our
                            land, air and water have been contaminated by an increasing number of waste materials and
                            substances that issue daily from factories, homes and vehicles .In some cases, this waste is
                            only an eyesore, which spoils the beauty of our surroundings, while in other cases, It is a
                            serious threat to our health and can result in death.
                            <br><br>
                            Some of the most dangerous waste substances are, without a doubt, those produced by
                            factories. Industrial waste often contains toxic substances that can kill plant and animal
                            life. When there is no proper government control, factories allow these substances to pour
                            into rivers, while their chimneys fill the atmosphere with poisonous fumes, sometimes in
                            areas no more than a few kilometers from heavily populated cities.
                            <br><br>

                            Nuclear waste is even more hazardous than industrial waste .Although everything is done to
                            ensure that it is buried safely at great depths, the fact remains that plutonium waste
                            continues to be dangerously radioactive for 24,000 years, while uranium waste remains so for
                            700 million years.
                            <br><br>
                            In towns and cities, the use of fossil fuels (oil, coal, and gas) for heating results in
                            large amounts of carbon dioxide filling the atmosphere .Although some cities have been made
                            "smokeless zones" where no coal or oil fires are allowed, the exhaust fumes from vehicles on
                            the roads has meant that air pollution continues to be a major problem.
                            But, if we stop to think, each of us is guilty of polluting our environment to some extent.
                            Almost everything we buy today comes in some sort of container or packaging , made of paper
                            plastic, glass ,or aluminium which we usually throw away .Besides being expensive to
                            collect, many of these materials -especially plastic , glass and aluminium -are very
                            difficult to get rid of and lie in huge dumps on the outskirts of many cities , one of the
                            ugliest types of pollution. Attempts have been made to encourage factories to recycle these
                            materials , but few have shown any interest.
                            <br><br>
                            How much longer can we allow this pollution to continue? Scientists tell us that the
                            increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may soon have disastrous effects. They
                            fear that it will raise average temperatures around the world and cause the polar ice caps
                            to melt .If this happens, they say the level of the world's oceans will rise by twelve to
                            eighteen feet (four to six meters ), and vast populated areas of our planet will be covered
                            by water. Can we afford to make such risks by continuing to pollute our environment?
